# MyFirstPrograms
Recently found my old lost pendrive and decided to look whats inside. Surprisingly I found my first ever programs!

These were written by me in my 9th grade (2014) and it brought back a lot of beautiful memories.

### IDE: BlueJ
### Programming Language: Java

## These programs are licensed under the beerware license üç∫
